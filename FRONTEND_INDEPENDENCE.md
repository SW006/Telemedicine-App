# Frontend Independence

This medical application frontend now runs independently without requiring a backend server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Removal ✅
- Removed the entire `backend/` directory and all its contents
- Eliminated Express.js server, database connections, and API routes

### 2. Authentication Updated ✅
- Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` to use mock authentication
- Test credentials:
  - **Admin**: `admin@test.com` / `admin123`
  - **Doctor**: `doctor@test.com` / `doctor123`
  - **Patient**: `patient@test.com` / `patient123`
- OTP verification uses: `123456`

### 3. API Calls Mocked ✅
- All API calls now use mock data instead of backend endpoints
- Updated files:
  - `src/app/complaints/page.tsx` - Mock complaint submission
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx` - Mock admin data
  - `src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Mock password reset
  - `src/lib/dataService.ts` - Mock doctor application submission

### 4. Configuration Cleaned ✅
- Removed backend URL references from `next.config.ts`
- No more API rewrites to backend server

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Features Still Working

- ✅ User authentication (with mock credentials)
- ✅ Doctor signup and admin approval system (with mock data)
- ✅ Patient dashboard and appointments
- ✅ Doctor dashboard and patient management  
- ✅ Lab tests booking
- ✅ Medicine delivery ordering
- ✅ Complaint submission
- ✅ All UI components and navigation

## Mock Data

The application uses realistic mock data for:
- User profiles (admin, doctor, patient)
- Medical appointments and records
- Lab test results
- Medicine orders
- Complaint tracking
- Doctor applications and reviews

All form submissions are simulated with appropriate loading states and success messages.
